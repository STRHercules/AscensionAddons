# Ascension Addons

This repo contains the addons I use on Project Ascension along with a few custom modifications.

## Highlights

### [QuickGuildInvite](https://github.com/STRHercules/WotLKQuickGuildInvite)
* **Author**: Me (with help from ChatGPT)
* Custom addon written from scratch to add a right-click option for guild invites.

### ElvUI
* Forked and edited to include a `TransmogCollector` button in the bag bar.
  * [Code reference](AddOns/ElvUI/Modules/Bags/Bags.lua).

### AtlasLoot
* Edited to work on Ascension by adding support for the **Hero** class so loot tables display correctly.
  * [Code reference](AddOns/AtlasLoot/AtlasLoot.lua).

### TransmogCollector
* Normally auto-learns appearances silently. This version keeps that logic off and adds a minimap button so you can trigger the collection whenever you want.
* Click the button to learn all available appearances in your bags at once.
* Offers toggles to ignore vanity items, BoE items or epics and an option to skip collecting while grouped.

## Other Addons
Numerous other addons are included for QoL, such as DBM, Titan, TomTom, TSM and WeakAuras.
